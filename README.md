This is the "official" siterip of chrisnj.com in torrent form:

I have moved on to other things, but if you want to save anything from the site, this is your chance.

Torrent Tips:

1. Seeding will be slow, but steady.  Be patient.  It will most likely take several weeks to a month for you to download the full data set.  Also, make sure you have the hard drive space available before you start downloading.

2. Some torrent clients may have trouble with the large data set.  If you're having trouble, or things are not working as expected, I would recommend trying the `Transmission` or `Tixati` clients to see if that helps.

3. The torrent is publicly available and tracked on the DHT network.  If you're having trouble bootstrapping or finding peers, try manually adding trackers.  At the time of writing, <https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist> is a good source to find up-to-date trackers that can help bootstrap your initial connection.
